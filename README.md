## Functionality

<ul>
<li>Bcrypt, to encrypt our users passwords</li>
<li>SQL, to create the databases needed to store user information</li>
<li>Sequelize, to build our tables dynamically, build our models, and add, edit, and delete info</li>
<li>Handlebars, to dynamically build our website and fill in selected user information</li>
<li>Materialize, to make everything look really, really pretty</li>
<li>Express/Node, to give us a server to server our information from</li>
</ul>

## GameModes

Code Shooters comes with three game modes, and 3 difficulties.

# Joe'pocolypse Mode
In Jo-poc mode, You will be tasked with fighting off **redacted** with **redacted**. The Joes will fire incredibly fast lasers, and if you dont have Joe-di reflexes, you will end up as Code Dust!

# Menacing Denis Mode
In Men-den mode,You will be tasked with fighting off **redacted** with **redacted**. The Denis' will fire tons of slow lasers, and your ship will also move much slower. It can be menacing if you arent ready for the wave of **redacted** constantly flying at you!

# Clint'astrophe Mode
In Clint mode, You will be tasked with fighting off **redacted** with **redacted**. The Clint's seem like a normal challenge, but your firing rate will be drastically reduced. Make each shot count, because one wrong move and its game over!
