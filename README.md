## Description

Code Shooters takes a familiar game and gives it a **big** flavor boost. Start by creating your account and logging in to begin tracking your scores, skills and wins in each game mode!

## StartingUp

When you start the app up, you are presented with a login screen. You will enter your credentials here if you have previously created an account. Otherwise, please proceed to the create acount page, and create your account.

Once you have created your account and successfully logged in, you will arrive at the launch screen. From the launch screen you will be able to see your top scores, the top 5 scores from all players, and how many wins you have accumulated in each game mode. From here you can also select a background soundtrack, a ship of choice, and a game mode. Once you are ready, click "Launch" at the bottom of the screen to begin playing the game.

## Functionality

Our game uses a variety of different libraries and technology, including:

<ul>
<li>Bcrypt, to encrypt our users passwords</li>
<li>SQL, to create the databases needed to store user information</li>
<li>Sequelize, to build our tables dynamically, build our models, and add, edit, and delete info</li>
<li>Handlebars, to dynamically build our website and fill in selected user information</li>
<li>Materialize, to make everything look really, really pretty</li>
<li>Express/Node, to give us a server to server our information from</li>
</ul>

## GameModes

Code Shooters comes with three game modes, and 3 difficulties.

# Joe'pocolypse Mode
In Jo-poc mode, You will be tasked with fighting off **redacted** with **redacted**. The Joes will fire incredibly fast lasers, and if you dont have Joe-di reflexes, you will end up as Code Dust!

# Menacing Denis Mode
In Men-den mode,You will be tasked with fighting off **redacted** with **redacted**. The Denis' will fire tons of slow lasers, and your ship will also move much slower. It can be menacing if you arent ready for the wave of **redacted** constantly flying at you!

# Clint'astrophe Mode
In Clint mode, You will be tasked with fighting off **redacted** with **redacted**. The Clint's seem like a normal challenge, but your firing rate will be drastically reduced. Make each shot count, because one wrong move and its game over!
